# Airline-Reservation-System-Using-Java
I created these project using Java programming language that is mainly based on Airline Reservation System,
Switch Case, while loop, and Scanner class are used to build this system. The system will first present the user with the available options. View available seats, book a seat, and EXIT is available as a choice. The user must choose a useful option. The operation will be carried out as per the input choice.  The seats are stored in array seats, where 0 indicates an available seat and 1 represents a reserved seat.
